# Iris-Recognition-using-Matlab

## Description
This project implements an **Iris Recognition System** using MATLAB, applying advanced **image processing techniques** like **feature extraction**, **edge detection**, and **image segmentation** to analyze unique iris patterns for **biometric identification**. The system is designed to detect and match unique iris patterns, leveraging **Canny edge detection**, **Sobel filters**, and **Gaussian smoothing** to improve accuracy and reliability in the recognition process.

### Key Features:
- Image Acquisition and Preprocessing
- Edge Detection using **Canny** and **Sobel filters**
- Image Segmentation for Iris Pattern Extraction
- Feature Extraction for Biometric Identification
- High Accuracy with **Gaussian Smoothing** and Pattern Recognition

## Advantages
- **Highly Accurate**: The system leverages well-established image processing techniques such as edge detection and image segmentation, ensuring high accuracy in recognizing unique iris patterns.
- **Robust to Noise**: The use of **Gaussian smoothing** and other noise-reduction techniques ensures the system performs well even with noisy images.
- **Efficient and Fast**: MATLABâ€™s built-in functions for image processing allow for faster execution, reducing processing time when handling large datasets.
- **Scalable**: The system can easily be extended to include additional features, such as integrating with other biometric recognition systems (e.g., fingerprints or facial recognition).
- **Non-Invasive**: As iris recognition is a non-contact method of biometric identification, it is safer and more user-friendly than fingerprint or facial recognition.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need **MATLAB** installed along with necessary libraries for image processing.

### Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jeet-51/Iris-Recognition-using-Matlab.git


## Future Work:
The following enhancements are proposed to improve the functionality and scalability of the Iris Recognition System:

- **Integration with Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to improve the system's ability to handle diverse iris images and automatically adapt to various lighting conditions and image qualities.
  
- **Multimodal Biometric Systems**: Combine iris recognition with other biometrics, such as **fingerprint** or **facial recognition**, to create a more robust, accurate, and secure system for identity verification. This multimodal approach would address limitations inherent in using a single biometric.

- **Real-Time Processing**: Enhance the system to handle live video streams, allowing for real-time iris recognition. This would enable applications such as **access control**, **surveillance**, and **automated attendance systems**, where instant identification is crucial.

- **Deployment on Embedded Systems**: Adapt the iris recognition system for use on **low-cost embedded hardware** like Raspberry Pi or mobile devices. This would enable widespread deployment in consumer devices, security systems, and portable biometric authentication solutions.
